# Problem 1 is_balanced.py

This function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. For every closing bracket, it checks if the corresponding opening bracket is at the top of the stack. If the brackets are balanced, the stack will be empty at the end of the iteration.

# Problem 2 sequence.py

This function uses a set (seen) to keep track of unique elements encountered so far. It iterates through the input sequence and adds elements to the result list only if they haven't been seen before. This way, it maintains the original order while removing duplicates.

# Problem 3 Dictionaries.py

This function removes punctuation from the input sentence, converts it to lowercase, and then counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary. The result is a dictionary where keys are unique words, and values are the frequencies of those words in the sentence.
